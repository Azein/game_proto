# game_proto
The goal of this project is to build a JavaScript game engine along with small showcase game demo. For now I don't have any experience of
programming game engines and lack understanding of abstraction level required, but I plan to build something on top of such technologies as
React, Redux and redux-saga. 

After this work will be finished, I will consider decoupling engine features and creating a repo with only engine functionality.
And finally, maybe more games using this core will follow.
